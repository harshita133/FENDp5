## Assumptions required to solve the problem
The following assumptions were made by evaluating the code and all given instructions:
 - most of our solution can be done in TODO

 - ES6 is OK to use without transpiling with Babel

 - TODO: other assumptions as we go

## Work Flow
I followed git commit guidelines, a 'Git Flow' branching model committing into feature branches that are merged into develop until ready to test with GitHub the repository of truth. The repo was built from scratch with a copy of the baseline code added to my standalone repo - this allows for demonstration of issue template and for later experiments after the course. 

At key steps in the work completion, I create a release branch that is merged into develop and master with a semantic version tag on the master branch following 

I used Atom and GitKraken with a Chrome browser for testing. I copied my preferred label scheme into my repository from my other repositories using [Github Label Manager](https://www.dorukdestan.com/github-label-manager/).

TODO: gulp was used  as follows: //TODO: get the linting and live serving working and review/consider sass and jasmine based on provided code and/or project rubric.

See develop branch for commit history with git commit style followed. Releases made to master and develop with tags on master following [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).
